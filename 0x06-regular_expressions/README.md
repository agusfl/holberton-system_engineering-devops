**Background Context:**

For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Because the focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex), here is the Ruby code that you should use, just replace the regexp part, meaning the code in between the //:

``#!/usr/bin/env ruby``
``puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join``

## Environment
 
* Language: Bash script using Ruby
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly ``#!/usr/bin/env ruby``
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
 > **Note:** The file shoul have executable permissions: ``chmod u+x [filename]`` --> run with ``./filename``
